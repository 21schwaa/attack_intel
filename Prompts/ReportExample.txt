=== PENETRATION TEST REPORT TEMPLATE ===

1. Executive Summary
Brief overview of the purpose, scope, and general results of the test.

Example:
"This report outlines the findings of a passive reconnaissance test performed on ExampleCorp. The objective was to evaluate publicly available information that could be used in a cyberattack. While no critical vulnerabilities were discovered, several exposed subdomains and employee emails were identified."

---

2. Scope & Methodology
Explain what was tested and how â€” include tools and phases.

Example:
"The test focused on passive reconnaissance using tools such as Shodan, theHarvester, and WHOIS. No active scanning or system probing was performed. The methodology followed OSINT-based enumeration and threat modeling to identify publicly available organizational data."

---

3. Key Findings
Summarize what was found, why it's important, and potential impact.

Example:
"Three open-facing login pages were discovered. Additionally, 24 subdomains were enumerated, two of which pointed to legacy systems. Employee emails were also retrievable from social media and third-party job boards, increasing risk of phishing."

---

4. Technical Details
For each key finding, show the command used and why it's significant.

Example:
Command:
`theHarvester -d examplecorp.com -b all`

Summary:
"This tool identified 12 email addresses, including multiple from the HR and IT departments."

Insight:
"The exposure of departmental email addresses allows for targeted phishing and whaling attacks."

---

5. Recommendations
Give actionable, practical fixes or improvements.

Example:
- Remove unused subdomains and enforce wildcard DNS cleanup.
- Mask or limit employee contact details on external platforms.
- Implement a quarterly OSINT audit policy.

---

6. Conclusion
Wrap up with the organization's general risk posture and next steps.

Example:
"ExampleCorp demonstrates moderate resilience to OSINT-based threats. While no critical data was exposed, the presence of legacy endpoints and open contact info poses a moderate risk. A full external penetration test is advised."
